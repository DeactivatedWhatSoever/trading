    "\n",
    "A price gets designated if there's ever a trade between two minds. If something never gets traded, you won't be able to know the price. There won't be any price if there's no history of trade. The two minds, buyer: wait until the price is what you want(fall), or match the sellers demand(higher). Seller: wait until the price is what you want(rise), or match the buyers demand(lower). \n",

    "\n",
    "Price is determined by the mass of traders, bulls, bears, undecided people. In every aspect, on all the people who are in there, who actually trade, are in there. This is mass psychology. It is all of the people's consensus that make the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Behavior Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "A pattern of behaviors. Like panic sell, bull run, these things are mostly patterns. But this pattern is a great deal of mass psychology between the buyers, sellers and undetermined. Chart patterns are also something that shows the repeated behavior patterns of those people in the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now think, a technical analyst is wanting some history to repeat. So he can bet on whether to go buy or sell. If that analyst sees a bull coming in, then he'll buy, if the bear comes in, he'll go short. If the bulls and bears are fighting, which would mean sideway markets, I'm sure the analyst will just try to think who will win. Or he could profit from a pattern of sideways. Inside the box when both parties are weak. Then obviously, those parties will fight until one of them makes a breakout."

    "\n",
    "All the professional traders think of the market as a mass of people. A place where everyone is against you. As well as you are against them. You are the only team, but the others are not. Even though you take sides with the bulls or bears, with a bad timing you'll die. \n",
    "\n",
    "And do you know what others are killing you? The government who gets your cash, the brokers that gets your commission, the market makers that gives you slippage. God damn it the market is so cruel and harsh.\n",

    "## Worldwide Crowds\n",
    "\n",
    "You're actually fighting with a crowd of people. After all the market is just a crowd of people trying to profit from each other. Killing each other to make money. You need to know and study mass psychology to actually understand the market. Also, for you to profit better, you must understand yourself and your behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Groups, Not Individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "People easily give their minds to the crowd. It's what makes them people, and if there's 20 people in a room, it's hard to make them all have individual thoughts. A few people who seem powerful makes others think in the same way with them and there'll be a crowd. Not a number of individuals who have individual thoughts. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's not wise to go 'against' the crowd. If you go against the crowd who makes the trends, you'll be dead by their number. The only way to profit is go with them. But you may also decide not to go with them. Here comes your thoughts. If you have your own thoughts, you'll know why the crowd is going the way they're going. When you have the logical thoughts that align, go with them. If your thoughts don't align, you may take the decision of not taking the same risk as the crowd. But don't go against them. You'll typically lose. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's once when the trend changes that you go against them. Actually, if you think that the trend is going to change, then you may just not follow the 'current' trend and wait for the next trend. That's what your actually doing if you interpret it in the right way. You're waiting for the next trend, and that trend will be going the opposite way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you're either going with them, or not. \n",

    "## The Source of Money\n",
    "\n",
    "The source of money comes in from everyone. You have to stake your money, and all the other people who come into the market need to stake their own. Money to money. If you lose, you may lose everything. If they lose, they lose everything. It's best to have a theory that the market has the most smartest people around. Only the people who have known the financial system, this democracy is shit and know how to live it the proper way. They are the people who know life better than the other people who are living. So don't think them as just sheep and hogs. It's the bulls and bears who are most in it, and it's from those that you have to win from.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Individual Traders\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual traders mostly come from business backgrounds and are very good at them. The futures market tends to be farmers and engineers. They may be good at maths and taking risks, but there are also two groups. Of course there'll be professional and amateurs. The rational and irrational. What makes the rational is, they are serious in the market and do their irrational stuff outside the market. Irrational people might as will be irrational everywhere including the markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These people mostly are there for a living. So they need to earn money to actually keep the food on the table. They're pretty desperate. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Institutional Traders\n",
    "\n",
    "I certainly got a lot of information over here. But we can categorize it into two sides. The edge that institutional traders and the downsides of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge: They have the most smartest people over there, they don't trade with their own money, there are people who manages their risks so all you do is just search for signals. For insider trading, they have intelligence groups that give institutions the information first before the news! Also when you trade, no commission is what you can think. Of course they're the market makers so slippage won't be that big to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Downsides: They 'have' to trade. They have to trade whether it's in their edge or not. Even if institutional traders go make their own, they'll mostly lose because of their individual psychology. They never traded with their OWN money! And that'll feel really hard because it's not easy to trade with your own money and maintain your wishful thinking. Taking in charge of yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Sword Makers\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools you use for trading. A tool box, black box, and a gray box. A tool box is like tradingview. Where you get all the indicators, all the plotting functions and all that. It's just for pure analysis on your own and testing your own trading systems. A black box is like heybit, the one that I'm using. This is a no brainer, and it might work for a bit but it'll die eventually. And you'll have to buy another one that works again. A gray box is where the strategies are disclosed, but the parameters can be tweaked by the user. Or it could be the opposite. The parameter values could be more valuable than the strategy if the strategy is open source.\n",

    "# The Market Crowd and You\n",
    "\n",
    "Traders bet on the opinion and mood of the crowd. Whether they're saying to buy, but just moderate, or they want to buy like crazy.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's whether when to enter or exit from the crowds opinion. If you go with your crowd without your own thoughts, then you're fucked. That means you'll lose. You have to have your own opinion even though when you go with the crowd. That's the relationship that you must have with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experts on Crowds\n",
    "\n",
    "The experts in crowds tell that crowds try to find a leader and most go for a cause or thing. It takes so short time to go crazy and so long to make the the original selves that they were before joining the crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group members may catch a few trends, but they'll be dead. Successful traders are independent thinkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Join?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's in our genes. Free will is always been told to us but are genes tell us that we have to have a leader and give everything to him. It's my job to get out of the genes and learn to have my free will and thoughts for myself. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you make a trade, and your emotions go loud when it goes the way you want or it goes the opposite, it's bad. Also, if you suddenly take risks and take opposite trades, you're fucked. You've lost. If the crowd goes against you, there's the stop-loss and that'll make you exit. You lost because you analyzed it, you took the risk, and you were wrong. That's all. Next time you analyze, take the risk, and you be right, that's it. Don't put your emotions, or join the crowd. That's your death if you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Crowd Mentality\n",
    "\n",
    "The mentality of the crowd are very primitive. They don't use their forehead. Don't argue with the crowd. It's either follow them or judge with your own head to stay where you are. If you fight to crowd, you'll lose 100 percent, unless you have the power to actually devour the crowd. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Who Leads?\n",
    "\n",
    "If emotions come to you, you'll go find the leader of the crowd. In the traders case, it can be gurus, news, and all that other stuff that makes you trade with other's thoughts. The thing is, it's the 'price' that leads the market. If you have emotion to that price, you won't be able to see when to exit or stay. You'll keep losing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The price is in your favor, follow it and exit when you think that it's going to go against you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "Being independent as a trader means, you have a plan. A plan that knows when to enter, and when to exit, with a money management strategy. When you don't have a plan and see the crowd, you'll most likely be impulsive and enter without an exit strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think it'll be a good thing to have a system when you see 'intuitively' that it's a good trade to enter. But even though you just enter on the spot, you should exit in a short amount of time because you gave a short amount of thought in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Positive Group\n",
    "\n",
    "Most groups just give you biases and make you emotional. But professional groups make you grow. So what is a professional group? What makes it that? The members first have to keep secrets with each other. No one knows anything about each other and trade. After a certain amount of time, they tell each other how they traded with what analysis. And then, they'll be able to learn from each other. It's a really great thing to have if it's like this. It'll be a positive group! I should do this with my trader friends lol. Lets do this!"

    "\n",
    "Technical analysis is actually social psychology. Which is pretty cool to hear, and I think it really does that stuff. If you know the real meanings of each indicator. Then you'll be able to profit from it. Whether to go bearish, bullish, or just fight. These are the trends of the market. This is what we have to catch and go with or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strong Feelings\n",
    "\n",
    "More buyers than sellers? Supply and demand says this. If there are people who 'want' to buy more, there's going to be a price raise. People who want to make more, will make the price go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The buys and sells never change in number. There's no such thing as more buyers than sellers. If 200 shares are sold, 200 shares are bought. You have to think that it's just a change in that price. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the trend go up, the bulls must have optimistic feelings about the price. By optimistic, they'll feel that the price will go up and up. The stronger the feelings, the sharper the price will go up in a given timeframe. Also, the bears must be scared to sell the shares in a high price. They'll keep trying and trying not to sell at low price. They'll keep on waiting for the highest price until the bulls lose enthusiasm. If the bulls start to get bored, the bears come to get to their feelings. The more the bears emotions go stronger, the trend will go down. They will sell short and keep making the prices go down and profit. The bears will keep on thinking that it's a discount and keep buying until their emotions become about equal. They'll fight with the price and the market will go sideways.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rallies and Declines\n",
    "\n",
    "The market declines when the bulls have fear and the bears have greed. It's a really cool thing to know that fear is three times powerful than greed. But the problem is, both bulls and bears have greed and fear. When the bulls have greed, the bears have fear because their shorts get wiped out and margin called. So it wipes out immediately, which makes them have no chance to exit for fearful people. They'll freeze at the screen. If they were rational traders, they'll get out quick. Greed makes it go up, and the bears will keep losing because of their fear. But the opposite is true too. Bulls will sell in panic and the bears will  short with greed. If the feeling of greed is stronger, it'll go down or up, but the problem is, to make it go up or down, that means greed is stronger than 3 times more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever direction it goes, greed should be stronger than fear. But it's likely to have a stronger fear since it's already 3 times more strong. Betting on their fear is likely to make you win. Greed can also be fear of missing out. If fear goes to the greedy's side, then we can bet that it'll go to that direction in a strong manner. Bet on the stronger feeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Greed and FOMO will team up. That's when it'll go steep. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Price Shocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Bearish divergence indicator → A great opportunity to short. The exact opposite is the same. Bullish divergence is a great opportunity to buy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have to think of this cause. How a price shock occurs. First, if the bulls are going greedy and they’re doing good, everyone starts to think that they’re doing good. The bears start to have fear and they start to change positions. The bears go bigger and eventually they get weak. It’s time for the bears to strike back. It all happens again, the price reversal gives a big price shock in whatever direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Social Psychology\n",
    "\n",
    "A technical analyst is an applied social psychologist equipped with a computer. It’s about mass psychology. You can have indicators of the crowds madness or emotion level. The problem is, you shouldn’t get in there. If you go with he crowds, you’ll be carried on with it and you’ll be one of the crowds. It’s important to keep on track of what your trading strategy was. If you start to ignore the indicators and analysis you did, you’ll get buried."

When will their feelings go wild or weak, the crowds directions, that’s what you have to do first. Set when to get in and out, what to do when the other side of the probability happens, managing your money and managing your mind not to get greedy or fearful, or become the crowd. \n",

But if you lost, then you should think again and see you were biased. \n",
