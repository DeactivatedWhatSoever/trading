    "\n",
    "Intelligence, secrets, education. These things are not the factors of differentiating a good trader from a bad trader. It's about controlling yourself. And believing, or knowing that there's no such secret sauce of something that I don't know. That's whats so good about maths. There's no secret in maths, all the things are out there and you can just get to know them if you study. Trading is also that. There's a lot of technical indicators, fundamental information, even sentimental information out there. It's just how you use it. You can know anything, it's about the bad thoughts you have.\n",

    "Random thought: That's why you put in only 2% of your money for a stake. It's because, you'll see that that asset will rise, but if it doesn't all you lose is your 2%. Also, if it goes high, it'll go high. So you bet on more of it when it actually goes high, if it doesn't, cut off your losses quick. Putting all your money into one thing is too much risk. You have to think of the other things that can actually make you win. \n",

No. I'm here to be good at trading, not getting a hell lot of money. If I'm good at trading, no matter the size of the account, money will be flooding in. So don't think about your past about \"if only I had that much money ... \" → This must be stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even people who have like 200 million dollars and wiped that out in a single day said the same thing. \"If only my account was bigger!\" → Yes, that's some pretty fucked up thoughts. And I'm going to learn from this book that's not important. It's all about money management, no matter how low your account is. Don't forget discipline. If you had discipline, you'd follow your system. When to sell, when to buy, not trying to have so much greed with yourself. \n",

    "\n",
    "Nothing goes forever. No trading system will give you cash forever. Programming, selling those strategies huh? Well that's not how the world works. Why would be there firms then? Those people keep on nurturing their programs and try to make more profit with new strategies. No one can make an autopilot forever. It's just a matter of a timeframe, and when that timeframe starts, you have to find a better solution inside that timeframe and apply it. Even though that timeframe is past, you have to deal with the past strategy if you don't want to lose money. This is how you keep on going. Autopilot is a myth.\n",

    "\n",
    "People tend to believe in leaders. That makes us weak and don't think for ourselves. Someone could be right or wrong, but you have to have your own opinion, your own reasons, and your own thoughts. If you don't have that and start to follow the people who have this and that, that'll make you ill. You'll never do anything by yourself, and when that guru disappears, you'll be crying for that guru to come back. Trading, or even life doesn't go that way. You have to do it yourself.\n",

    "This section really was a funny read. The American market has a 4 year cycle. 2.5~3 years of ups, 1~1.5 years of downs. People don't know which guru is going to win, but when a guru starts to win all the time, the mass media comes up to that guru and he'll be dead in a short amount of time. Because, when mass media knows about that thing, it's time to think that's going to die. That's what mass psychology does. It can't go up infinitely, it has to crash sometime for another thing to rise up high. \n",
    "\n",
    "It'll be a good strategy to find a guru when he's an outsider and really see whether that works or not.

    "Market cycle gurus are mostly in the stock market. But the magic method gurus are mostly in the derivatives market. Where a great strategy may be profitable for a few months, or maybe a year, once that strategy is popular, and a lot of capital comes into that method, it'll start to make you lose. Then it gets destroyed into pieces of hatred and people try to find a new kid on the block. \n",

    "The cool thing is, this can actually be used as a country scoped thing. If it works in the USA, it won't somewhere else, but it could be the opposite some time.

It's actually really similar to the financial market. People who are professional know the long-term game because they know when the edge for them will come with maths.

Okay, now the problem here is, you need to know when something's going wrong. If you trade because of the urge, you'll wonder up taking risks, and those risks will get bigger and bigger when you keep losing. Of course you'll take risks again when you even win from those random events. You could get lucky, but you won't think that as luck. You'll think that as if you earned it. Which is bull shit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you keep losing, you have to see that as a signal to stop and see whether something's wrong. If there's something wrong, fix it and go again. Or just see that it's not the time.

For a money management factor, no more than risking 2% of your trading account could be a rule. Of course there's going to be a lot of other money management strategies. But whatever, if you lose more than that, because of commission, slippage, or over staking, then that's a lost. If you made a businessman's risk and you lost money, that's still a win. Because that risk taking is just risk. If you lose the amount that's in the loss boundary, that's a win because you just made a businessman's risk, took it, and it didn't turn out. If you win with that risk, you still win. That's why stop losses and all that unit making is so important. \n",

    "4. Develop a method for analyzing the market—that is, \"If A happens, then B is likely to happen.\" Markets have many dimensions—use several analytic methods to confirm trades. Test everything on historical data and then in the markets, using real money. Markets keep changing—you need different tools for trading bull and bear markets and transitional periods as well as a method for telling the difference (see the sections on technical analysis).\n",
