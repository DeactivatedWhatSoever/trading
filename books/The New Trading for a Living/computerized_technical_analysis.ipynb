    "The only disadvantage of a computer is, you lose the physical feel of the change of price when you did it with pen and paper. So if I actually really change the price on my own, I could actually get that physical feeling of price change? Let's see if there can be a way to get that."

    "## Toolboxes\n",
    "\n",
    "A toolbox, that makes you have full control of everything. It gives you all the indicators, even make new ones, give parameters as you wish, all that. You can also compare the spreads between other markets. Which is really awesome. There are some things called scanners. It scans the market with the indicators that you put in. I think the scanners are the most important thing over here. It actually catches opportunities. Opportunities are things that can't be lost.\n",

    "\n",
    "Technical analysis tools don't really use a hell lot of computing power, but it's nice to have a good one. There's even programs for iPads! It's nice to have a lot of screens. So that's why all those traders had so much screens lol. I'm going to be the first one to do it in one screen!\n",

    "\n",
    "The more real-time you get, the more harder the game. It's because, all the candles are weak in real-time. Look at ticks, 1 minute markets. It looks like hell. I'm sure there'll be a lot of opportunities if you look at the past. But no, it's really hard to actually predict the market at that level of chaos. In longer timeframes, it's a bit more easier to identify the state of the market. Because of its strong indicating nature, it's much easier for a person to analyze it with more time. \n",

I might as well do like 100 trades a year, but still. If I win that much, I'm sure I'll win. If I win 100 trades, and even those trades are like 1% in profit, I get like 33 times more. Don't worry. You'll get your turn. You'll do it. Just start with a seed that doesn't kill you. I'm thinking of 10k. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, traders don't look at more than 100 stocks. They look at 100 stocks, and try to find the best 10 to trade.

    "\n",
    "All the indicators have a base of open, close, high, low, and volume. The markets have trends, trading zones, and mass psychology. There are three types of market indicators. Trend-following indicators, oscillators, and miscellaneous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend-following indicators are obviously best for identifying trends and riding trends. It could also give you nice clues that it's 'not' trending. Which will contradict with oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oscillators give you great indication of the trading zone. It lets you know when the trend is going to end, or maybe reverse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly miscellaneous, gives you mass psychology. So you have to have all three of them always. See whether they get into it nicely or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to actually trade when all the indicators scream at you to take a look at them and make a position. If it doesn't indicate it like that, just pass it. There'll be another time for you to enter that stock. After all, we're swing traders, and can trade whenever we want, and we have a lot of time. Overnights! \n",

    "\n",
    "P: price, N: number of days.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of moving averages: simple, exponential, and weighted. The greatest flaw of a moving average is, it responds two times of a change. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Twice as Much Bark\n",
    "\n",
    "So a simple moving average changes two times when a new price comes in. The meaning of a new price is, there's going to be a price that's too old and going to be dropped off. If a really high or low price is dropped off, the average will go high or low 'suddenly'. That'll give you false information about trends. Of course the bigger the number of days, it won't actually make it big but, the lower the days, it'll make the average go wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, moving averages were popular because of its simple calculation. Nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Market Psychology\n",
    "\n",
    "A moving average represents an average consensus of the timeframe. The average price of people who bought it. If the price is below the moving average, people are bearish than before, and if the price is above the moving average, people are bullish than before. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponential Moving Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "EMA = Ptod * K + EMAyest * (1 - K)\n",
    "\n",
    "K = 2 / N + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "N = number of days in the EMA \n",
    "\n",
    "Ptod = today's price\n",
    "\n",
    "EMAyest = the EMA of yesterday\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive is what we need ... \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of EMA's nature, it is highly weighted on the most recent prices. And the weight goes lighter on the old prices. So the old prices shift away and the recent prices gets more attention. I think it's a pretty nice way to actually understand this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Length of a Moving Average\n",
    "\n",
    "Best moving average length is finding out the market cycle. An uptrend, downtrend and done. You should pretty much get to know what a cycle looks like properly lol. Whatever the dominant market cycle, just divide it by two and there's your moving average. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can just use 22(trading days), or 26(half of trading weeks). I should find the optimum parameter for each values of timeframes. I can't always change around parameters for each stock. Also, if I do keep optimizing them, objectivity will reduce. It'll be more subjective since I'm the one optimizing, and that'll be over parameter tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see other books and see what the other books tell about the optimum number of a moving average. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not about predicting the future. That isn't possible. It's about measuring the relative power of bulls and bears, monitoring the trend, and managing positions. You see, if you know who's stronger at the moment, you'll know who'll trend. And then you manage positions for stop-loss, enter, and exit. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. When an EMA rises, make a long position. When it falls, go for a short position. Make stop-losses when it touches the EMA. If it's above the EMA and touched, make that your stop-loss. If it touches again while the price rises, you should update your stop-loss on that one too. \n",
    "2. When the EMA falls, make a short position. Make a protective stop in the minor highs. Update while your position keeps trending.\n",
    "3. When the EMA goes sideways, it's time to switch gears. \n",
    "\n",
    "A whipsaw is a rapid reversal of a trading signal. In what timeframe and number of days you're using, it can make your moving average sensitive to the price, or make it not sensitive and just think about the trend. So you might lose some money or make higher risks because of sudden drawbacks. Should know how to profit from these too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three-way strategy is where we overcome the disadvantages of the moving averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More on Moving Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving averages 'sometimes' act as if they're support or resistance. Moving averages can be used on other indicators instead of price. A lot of statistical things can be happened over here. So you can actually use like the average between a high and low for the moving average. Or any combination of the ohlcv. \n",
    "\n",
    "The proper way to plot a simple moving average is 'lagging'. Which I don't know the reason really. Is it because of the instant changing of the recent price? A trend is rather made without the recent prices? Dunno. So it's best to lag it of half the days of the moving average. If it's 10, then lag 5. But not much with the EMA. Just a couple of days of you have 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "A weighted moving average allows you to assign any weight to any day. But it's very complicated, and this means more optimization of parameters. You need to have an idea why you're weighting that certain day or whatever. A thesis would have big clues about this. Giving big weights on the first day of the month or the last day of the month and etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dual EMAs\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have dual EMAs, you can see the divergence of short-term and long-term. Make the long-term 2, and short-term 1 as a ratio. So if you have a 22 EMA, then put in a 11 EMA for short-term. Between these two lines, that is the value zone. What kind of value lives? I'm not pretty sure of what the author is saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving Averages and Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Channels. So if you put two moving averages in parallel, that's a channel. That channel must have 95% of the prices inside the width/height of the channel. It's pretty much a performance meter. Let's try and find out about this!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prices, Values, and the Value Zone\n",
    "\n",
    "Price and value. This is something that we need to really concentrate on. The true meaning between price and value. We buy low valued stock and sell high valued stock. Price is explicit. It's always out, and it always will be there. Fundamental analysts try to find out the value of a stock with the money flow and all that. But the thing is, they get manipulated and sometimes it's not just right. They don't always tell the truth, and they might as well be on a really bad time and maybe not out to the public. That's how Axe always gets to short lol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The short-term and long-term EMA tells us that the value is between those two lines. It's pretty much logical to tell that the price between short-term and long-term averages can actually be the value. The people who thought in the long and short of time, might have an elapsed decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's impossible to trade with only one moving average. It won't verify whether you should trade. You have to know how to use the indicators, and find what they really mean. Also, you need to analyze the market in multiple timeframes. Then you can actually find a trend or a trading zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how to identify under and over valued stocks. This is a crucial ability to have."

    "An indicator that gives signals when convergence or divergence occurs. The crossover between three EMAs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Create MACD\n",
    "\n",
    "The MACD has three lines. Two lines of EMAs which are solid lines and another EMA line which is dashed. Two short-term signalers, and a base of a long-term EMA. Buy and sell signals occur when the MACD lines go over or under the signal line. When it goes above, it means it might go into an uptrend. Which is a great place to buy? But when it goes under the signal line, it's best to sell since it might be on a downtrend.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to calculate MACD?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate a 12-day EMA of closing prices\n",
    "2. Calculate a 26-day EMA of closing prices\n",
    "3. Subtract the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA, and plot their difference as a solid line. This is the fast MACD line.\n",
    "4. Calculate a 9-day EMA of the fast line, and plot the result as a dashed line. This is the slow Signal line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Market Psychology\n",
    "\n",
    "When the MACD line rises above the signal line, it means the bulls are dominant. And when the MACD line goes below the signal line, it means the bears are dominant. So buy when it rises the signal line and sell when it goes below the signal line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading Rules for MACD Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the fast MACD line crosses above the slow Signal line, it gives a buy signal. Go long, and place a protective stop below the latest minor low.\n",
    "2. When the fast line crosses below the slow line, it gives a sell signal, Go short, and place a protective stop above the latest minor high.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More on MACD Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't try to optimize the numbers too often. It'll give you the signals when YOU want. Which is not an ideal approach. That just makes it subjective. MACDs are here for YOU to KNOW that it's a trend or not. Not for YOU to control the trend lol.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick and dirty way to plot MACD Lines is just drawing a 12 and 26 day EMA and use that as a proxy. \n",
    "\n",
    "## MACD-Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "MACD-Histogram = MACD line - Signal line\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicator gives technicians the ability to know which is dominant, and how strong they are growing!\n",
    "\n",
    "The green area, above 0, the taller the bulls are strong. The red area, below 0, the taller the bears are strong. Both tall polls indicate the strength and the color indicates which side. Which also means if the histogram indicates 0, there's going to be a reverse. If the histogram keeps on changing from 0, +-, I think that'll mean a trading range. Also the bricks won't be tall anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Market Psychology\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of the MACD Histogram reveals who is dominant in the market at the moment. The MACD Line and Signal Line need to be in a divergence to know whether the price is falling or rising. \n",
    "\n",
    "MACD Line > Signal Line + Histogram Up = Bulls are dominant AND the price is rising. Long.\n",
    "\n",
    "MACD Line < Signal Line + Histogram Down = Bears are dominant AND the price is falling. Short.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another thing to understand. Identifying the trend. After all, this indicator actually is a trend-following indicator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Price Up/Down + Histogram Up/Down = Trend is in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Price Up/Down + Histogram Down/Up = Trend is in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question can come because, the price is rising and the bears are dominant? That doesn't make sense. It means the trend is questionable. The price must go in the direction of the crowd who are dominant. That's what a trend is. But if that's not the thing, we can't tell whether it's a trend or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something to remember about the MACD Histogram. It doesn't show you the price explicitly. It only shows you the 'difference' of the MACD Line & Signal Line. The bigger the difference means the higher the slope. The price difference actually indicates that, the dominant are able to make price differences. If they have that much power, I think that makes sense of someone actually thinking that they have that much power.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Buy when MACD-Histogram stops falling and ticks up. Place a protective stop below the latest minor low.\n",
    "2. Sell short when MACD-Histogram stops rising and ticks down. Place a protective stop above the latest minor high. \n",
    "\n",
    "The MACD gives you two trading signals. The above rules are just light trading signals that appear a lot of the time. But trend related signals are rare and they are strong. They appear rarely in the daily charts and even more rarely in the weekly charts. But it's important to tell that they are that much strong as a signal. When the slope changes, and the price is with the same way of the slope. That's the big one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Expect a New Peak or Valley\n",
    "\n",
    "When the histogram slope reaches a new high, that means the difference between the MACD Line and the Signal Line are getting really bigger. And that strength of making the price go up or down is going to be huge. So you can identify a peak or a valley by checking the new peaks of a slope everyday. It must get bigger and bigger than yesterday to actually make a valley or a slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More on MACD-Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical indicators become stronger when the timeframes are longer. It's a huge consolidation of consensus of price. That's why it's easy to trust because of its high probability. The author just mentions MACD over here but, it actually can be done in all timeframes. I guess there might be some indicators that don't work in certain timeframes right?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Divergences\n",
    "\n",
    "So divergence is the most powerful signal among all in technical analysis. What else could there be? The divergence between two average prices, or the divergence between the price and one indicator? Divergence between any indicator is the most powerful. And of course this divergence doesn't tend occur frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bullish Divergence\n",
    "\n",
    "The breaking of the centerline, ticking up from the second bottom. The bulls get dominant a little bit after a huge bear dominance. Then the bears go again, and they get killed by the bulls! Cross and recross the zero line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bearish Divergence\n",
    "\n",
    "A bearish divergence occurs when a new high occurs and then a pull back happens. The oscillator reaches below the zero. 쌍고, 쌍저. 이걸 뜻하는구나 ... They also call it the missing right shoulder in chart patterns lol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the divergences must not be too far from each other. They must be at least 20 bars, and 40 bars at max. `Two Roads Diverged: Trading Divergences` → This book has all the details. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Triple Bullish or Bearish Divergences\n",
    "\n",
    "A triple bullish or bearish divergence can happen. Which means, a normal divergence happens, and it goes for one more time. And that'll be a bigger trend reversal. Maybe this is the all-famous Elliot Theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Hound of the Baskervilles\n",

    "# Directional System\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps traders to see whether it's worth following the trend. The trend must move fast 'enough' to make it worth. If there's just a little trend, then you might as well find another better trend and keep going with that. But if the direction, the angle of the trend is really high, it's best to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Construct the Directional System\n",
    "\n",
    "Directional movement is the largest part of today's range that is outside of yesterday's range. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If today's range extends above yesterday's range, Directional Movement is positive (+DM)\n",
    "2. If today's range extends below yesterday's range, Directional Movement is negative (-DM)\n",
    "3. If today's range is inside of yesterday's range or extends above and below it by equal amounts, there is no Directional Movement (DM = 0). If today's range extends both above and below yesterday's range, DM is positive or negative, pending on which part of the \"outside range\" is larger.\n",
    "4. On a limit-up day, +DM equals the distance from today's close to yesterday's high. On a limit-down day, -DM equals the distance from today's close to yesterday's low. \n",
    "\n",
    "I totally don't get anything over here. I'm going to go see a YouTube video and see if I can figure it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "I did watch a YouTube video, but I don't really get anything about how the indicators are made, how they're calculated, and what they really mean by that. I sort of get the averages and the range stuff but I don't really get the intuition of this really simple math. What does a range mean, what does it mean when two averages plus and minus, what the hell does that all mean in statistical thinking. God damn it lol. I really need to get this math working. Until then, I think it's best to at least have an intuition, and just study what these indicators mean at what point.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all, it's whether to get a buy or sell signal, or identify it's a trend or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Crowd Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Directional system indicates how much power the bulls and bears have. That power comes from price movements. If the price is up from a range bigger than yesterday, the bulls strength are absolutely strong. On the other hand, the price is down from a range bigger than yesterday, the bears strength are strong. \n",
    "\n",
    "The positive directional line indicate the bulls. The negative directional line indicates the bears. If the positive is above the negative, the bulls are stronger in driving the prices and it'll go up. If the negative is above the positive, the bears are stronger in driving the prices and it'll go down. It shows a trend if they are pretty much apart from each other. If they are close to each other, it's not trending.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ADX(Average Directional Indicator) is the line that represents whether the market is in trend or consolidation. The spread between the negative and the positive lines go bigger, the ADX gets higher. Which means a trend is getting stronger. When the negative and positive spreads go small, the ADX gets lower, and that'll mean consolidations, no trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trade only from the long side when the positive Directional line is above the negative one. Trade only from the short side when the negative Directional line is above the positive one. The best time to trade is when the ADX is rising, showing that the dominant group is getting stronger. \n",
    "2. When ADX declines, it shows that the market is becoming less directional. There are likely to be many whipsaws, When ADX points down, it is better not to use a trend-following method.\n",
    "3. When ADX falls below both Directional lines, it identifies a flat, sleepy market. Do not use a trend-following system but get ready to trade, because major trends emerge from such lulls.\n",
    "4. The single best signal of the Directional system comes after ADX falls below both Directional lines. The longer it stays there, the stronger the base for the next move. When ADX rallies from below both Directional lines, it shows that the market is waking up from a lull. When ADX rises by four steps (i.e., from 9 to 13) from its lowest point below both Directional lines, it \"rings a bell\" on a new trend. It shows that a new bull market or bear market is being born, depending on what Directional line is on top.\n",
    "5. When ADX rallies above both Directional lines, it identifies an overheated market. When ADX turns down from above both Directional lines, it shows that the major trend has stumbled. It is a good time to take profits on a directional trade. If you trade large positions, you definitely want to take partial profits. \n",
    " Market indicators give hard signals and soft signals. For example, when a moving average changes direction, it is a hard signal. A downturn of ADX is a soft signal. Once you see ADX turn down, you ought to be very, very careful about adding to positions. You should start taking profits, reducing positions, and looking to get out. \n",

    "\n",
    "It's best to buy below value, or short above value. The volatility level from the ATR is going to help you when to enter. So how low are you going to enter? Normal drawbacks go to ATR-1 level. So it's best to enter there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stops\n",
    "\n",
    "Put a stop at the ATR-2 level. If you put it more than that, you'll eventually get into the normal trading zone and your stop will get triggered. Placing your stop further away your entry point will make your stop get hit at trend reversals. Which will pretty much hurt. It's better to get out fast and get in again when you can.\n",

    "ATR-1~3, ATR- -1~-3. These levels are where you put targets on. Put your first target on ATR1, second and third on ATR2 and 3. Those are good indicators of targets. If they go up that much and you profit, sell and get in. Or do the opposite.\n"

    "When something is overbought is, the price is too high and it's ready to go down. If it gets near the highs, then we have to keep an eye on it. When something is oversold, it means it's too low and it's read to go up again. The turning point. That's what we are trying to identify.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an up or downtrend is happening, overbought and oversold could happen for weeks and months. That means it's not time to actually use these oscillators. A very important skill for a trader to have is, the ability to know what indicator to use and when to use what. When to rely on trend-following and when to rely on oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to draw the price levels of what the oscillators gave us. Also, it's not good to use them when trends are happening since oscillators will give premature and dangerous signals. They are best used at trading zones. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen an oscillator which is the MACD Histogram. It gives you who's dominant and who's strong in the market. We got to view that because it derives from the MACD Lines, a trend-following indicator. We'll see Stochastic and RSI(Relative Strength Index)."

    "# Stochastic\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic tracks the relationship of each closing price and the recent high-low range. It has a fast line called %K and a slow line called %D. Of course the signal will come when there'll be a divergence. This does calculate the price, and it's about comparing two prices with each other so I don't think it gives you the idea of a trend. It's whether to buy or sell in a trading zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the price is above or below do this and that, consists of a trend is what I think. And when there's two lines of prices, and it doesn't care about the current price, then it's about whether it's going to reverse. I've got to understand all the components between oscillators and trend-following indicators. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Raw Stochastic = %\n",
    "%K = (Ctod - Ln / Hn - Ln) * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "Ctod = today's close\n",
    "Ln = the lowest point for the selected number of days.\n",
    "Hn = the highest point for the selected number of days\n",
    "n = the number of days for Stochastic, selected by the trader.\n",
    "2. %D, smoothing out %K. To make it the slow line.\n",
    "%D = (3-day sum of (Ctod - Ln) / 3-day sum of (Hn - Ln)) * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to plot stochastic. The fast and slow version. You see, the fast one is just plotting the one above. It leads to lots of whipsaws which is pretty much for a day trader thing. Professional traders tend to use the slow stochastic. Which is, taking the %D of the fast stochastic and having that as %K. And just calculate the %D with the %D of the slow stochastic. It gives you bigger and meaningful turns. It also filters out market noise and fewer whipsaws.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic is a percentage scale, which is 0~100. 20% and 80% are the reference marks to indicate whether it's overbought or oversold. \n",

    "## Crowd Psychology\n",
    "\n",
    "It's about whether the bulls can close the price near the high. If they keep going and keep closing prices near their new high, that means the bulls are strong. But when they start closing the prices not near the high that they made, it means they're losing their strength. If they can't keep with their new high, that means they're starting to lose strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bears will be able to make the prices go low. So if they keep on closing the price at their lows, it means the bears are really are strong. But if they start to not able to close the price near the lows, it means the bears are getting weaker. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stronger they are, the higher or lower the stochastic goes. If they get weaker, the stochastic starts to turn its direction and gives you a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Divergences, the level of Stochastic lines, and their direction. These three are the trading signals we can get from Stochastic!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Divergences\n",
    "\n",
    "It's about divergence between the 20% and 80% line. It mostly tells you about how the bulls and bears keep driving their prices, but at their highest point of price they can move, starts to decline, and the divergence begins. You can see it when the stochastic suddenly goes into the other direction. That's when you go long or short.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overbought and Oversold\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't long when the Stochastic is overbought(above 80%), and don't short when Stochastic is oversold(below 20%). \n",
    "\n",
    "Make a short or long below the low or high. And make a protective stop of the highest or lowest price. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Line Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "When both lines go in the same direction, it means it's a nice signal. But it mostly gives you the idea of a short-term trend. Maybe until the resistance or support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More on Stochastic\n",
    "\n",
    "On the weekly Stochastic, when the direction changes, you can see that the MACD-Histogram also changes, but 1 week later. If you see the Stochastic first, then you'll get a hint that the MACD-Histogram will change too.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to use wider timeframes if you're using Stochastic as a stand-alone oscillator. But if it's part of a trading system with trend-following indicators, you can use shorter timeframes with them."

    "\n",
    "Three types of trading signals. Divergences, chart patterns, and the level of RSI. Oh my, chart patterns are over here. RSI is not going to be easy! But what does it diverge with anyway? It only has the horizontal lines of 25 and 75.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bullish and Bearish Divergence\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A bullish divergence happens when the bears try to give it a strong go at the lowest price, and make another lower price than the lowest, but with not much strength. That's when the bulls get to know that the bears don't have much strength anymore. \n",
    " You can see it in the RSI with the lower horizontal line. For example, when the RSI goes below the lower horizontal line, it means it's oversold, and that's the strength fo the bears. But when the bears give it one more shot, but the price goes even down, but the RSI is on the horizontal line, then it's the divergence. GO LONG\n",
    "2. Just change all the things with bears to bull lol.\n",

    "### Charting Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "It's about support and resistance. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. When RSI breaks above its downtrend line, place an order to buy above the latest price peak to catch an upside breakout.\n",
    "2. When RSI breaks below its uptrend line, place an order to sell short below the latest price low to catch a downside breakout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RSI Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "When RSI rises above the upper reference, it means the bulls are strong but it's starting to get overbought. A good place to sell and sell short.\n",
    "\n",
    "When RSI rises below the lower reference, it means the bears are strong but it's starting to get oversold. A good place to buy and exit short.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so it's easy to think as a beginner to go indicator shopping. Also, we could just go and see that all the indicators say this and that, and we trade. And we lose and think that technical analysis doesn't work. This is an application area. The better you apply, the better you're going to be. Knowing a lot of indicators might be good, but it's best to know how they work, what they actually give, and find the signals it gives in multiple timeframes, and a strict hierarchy for their analysis."
