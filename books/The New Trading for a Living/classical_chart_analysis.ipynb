    "No wonder it's classical. In the modern world of chart analysis, most of the indicators are very close to objectivity. Which means, it's something you can trust. Objectivity gives you a high probability because it's what everyone sees. If it's the same with everything, then we can think that will happen. Classical chart analysis was actually made because there were no computers. Everyone had to draw the chart lines to actually update it. Also, they had to draw trend lines themselves. The author mentions that this is very subjective. If they want to buy, they could make the trend line a little steep. Or if they want to short, they'll do the opposite thing and make bear or bull bias. That's why he tries to avoid to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But my question is, how do you actually make it objective then? It must be a nice indicator and that's why everyone actually uses it. But the author also mentions that their's no such thing as diagonal. No diagonal trends. It's just a run, or price levels. Since there are price levels, only horizontal price lines matter. That's why resistance and support have objective meaning. \n",

    "# Charting\n",
    "\n",
    "In the old days, all you needed was a pencil and paper. You draw the lines on them and actually get to make an intuition of price feelings. You actually draw the prices, feel the prices with your pencil and paper. Which is kind of cool, but it's pretty dangerous. The reason for that danger is, it makes you get wishful thinking. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was an experiment that tries to know what are in people's minds. They just give them an inkblot and asked them what they saw. They made so many thoughts about it! They didn't tell the doctor that it was just an inkblot! This is the same in charting. It's the mood that makes you see. You actually get an opportunity to draw on it. That means, you'll draw what you want.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's the 'tend` that you have to focus on. Come to think of it, the people who buy first thing at the morning are actually professionals AND normal people. But of course, you could profit then because everyone does their job right after the market opens. Which looks pretty considerable. Everyone enters the market at the start. So the amateurs start the market, professionals close, bulls go for highs, bears go for lows. That's how you get it. If the high is too far away from the current price, that'll be a bearish move is what I'll think. Same for the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned so much over here. The open part is where the amateurs come in. The professionals keep an eye on it. The battle between the bulls and bears are determined by the close price. If the close price is near the high, the bulls won. If it's near the low, the bears won. You can see how much they won by calculating the length of the bar. If the length is really long, then sure, they one a big victory. Remember, highs and lows are the 'maximum' power of the bulls and bears. Amateurs never get to judge the price. Only the professionals do. If the close was higher, then the professionals were more bullish than amateurs. Otherwise, the professionals were bearish than amateurs.\n",

    "## Efficient Markets, Random Walk, Chaos Theory, and \"Nature's Law\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficient Market theory\n",
    "    - Price is reflected right away of all information that occurs. The problem is, this theory equates information with action. Information can be known to everyone, but that doesn't mean everyone will do the same action because of that information.\n",
    "- Random Walk\n",
    "    - All the markets movements are just random. Just a probability. If it were for computers, it could be? Or maybe quantum physics as it seems really random. But humans are not random. They have a brain which helps us memorize things. That memory tells us prices that people have seen. It makes resistance and support. A certain price will make people think, \"I saw this price! It's kinda cheap! I'll buy it!\", or \"God damn it up again like before! Gotta sell before it goes down!\". Don't ignore 'human' factors.\n",
    "- Chaos Theory\n",
    "    - The market is in chaos and the only way to get edge is when the market is in order. That's the only way we get an edge. WAIT. WAIT FOR THE BAIT! This theory is pretty much close to the truth is what the author says. When the market is chaotic, you don't have an edge. Which means, the market doesn't go as you think, mass psychology, the usual patterns don't work. I want a better definition of 'chaos' and 'order' in the markets.  But still, it's important to look at all the timeframes. If all the timeframes together, give a signal, then you should trade. If those timeframes seem to give no signals, it's chaos.\n",
    "- Nature's Law\n",
    "    - This is just a marketing scheme for amateurs to believe in forecasts, seeing the future and all that shit. I totally get it. It's time to get into reality. Look the market as it is. Objective is key in winning the market."

    "\n",
    "Daaaaang trendlines are actually classical charting! computerized analysis wins in the trend identification! For a sneak peak, exponential moving averages give us this thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Support and resistance, they get stronger if they touch it a lot. They swap places if a breakout happens. Remember to not get carried away with 'false' breakouts. They're little breakouts that happen. I saw this ... Bitcoin has a lot of false breakouts! \n",

    "A horizontal line has to connect to or more dots to make it support or resistance. \n",

    "## Memories, Pain, and Regret\n",
    "\n",
    "The memories of price gives you pain and regret. It always does. I am so into this. I'm starting to think the author like a god like now lol. I always regret of the prices. I should've bought that, I should've sold when. This is what makes resistance and support. \n",
    "\n",
    "Resistance is made when bulls are in pain of buying a position in the trading zone and went down. They have to hold their positions in pain. While the bears are regretting that they didn't short more. The pain of the bulls and the regret of the bears makes resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support is made when bulls regret that they should've bought more on the price that went up right before. The price that they remember, that bounced up, and they didn't buy more. On the other hand, the bears are in pain that they sold short and the price went up. They have to hold their positions in pain. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the think of it, the reason they're holding their positions is, it's the trading zone. This is where they can actually read the market, and where the market is in order.  Not chaos. The part when the markets are in chaos is, when a trend happens. It goes up or down too much. A rally in either direction makes chaos. All the emotions of mass traders making their trades. \n",

    "## Strength of Support and Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength has three factors. Length, height, and volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Longer then time, the stronger\n",
    "    - Days, months, years, it gets stronger, but it'll get weaker if it gets 'too' long. It's because people forget. Or they might not trader anymore. New people come in and those people don't know about the past. They'll just see the recent stuff. That means, it gets weaker at a certain point.\n",
    "- Higher the price gap, the stronger\n",
    "    - If the resistance and support have a 2%, 5%, 7% difference, it'll sure be really strong at 7%. People will tend to buy MORE at both points. All the traders will know what to do at that point.\n",
    "- Larger the volume, the stronger\n",
    "    - If there's a lot of volume in each trading day, that sure means how active that stock is. Everyone is just looking at it. This will actually give time a bigger effect. If the volume keeps on being moderate, I'm sure people won't forget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength in dollars = congestion days * average day volume and price. A moving average for a day would be right, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A protective stop, which would be a stop-loss, should be made above the resistance when your on short, and below the support. It's because you'll lose a lot if it makes a reversal. But if it rallies, or keeps on going that direction, you'll profit a lot!\n",
    "2. The strong timeframes tell you that it's way stronger than the daily, or even hourly. It's because there's that much people inside that timeframe, and that the opinion will be stronger in time. So if a longer timeframe is going to hit a major support or resistance, it's best to get ready to exit and wait for a breakout or reversal. \n",
    "3. False breakouts. I thought there weren't stuff like this lol. But there was in technical analysis. I feel that I know a lot than them. But still, it's best to get to know more and more, and make it mine by actually winning the trade with this. \n",
    " To get to the real thing, when the price gets to the resistance or support, it's a major chance to buy or sell short. But when false breakouts happen like, it gets below the support or above the resistance and come back to the level, you can use those false breakouts as a protective stop. It's best to make a protective stop near the top of false breakouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "People tend to love round numbers. You should put a few cents or some random odd numbers to make it happen. I think using 7 and 3 would be a nice choice since it's pretty much a hard number to actually get in as a price. Got it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## True and False Breakouts\n",
    "\n",
    "As a professional trader, you have to love false breakouts. You have to know that it's a great indicator of that it might rally into a direction. Also, use protective stops for you to make a nice insurance for your positions. The high of the false breakouts is a nice stop place!\n",
    "\n",
    "The longer the time that's making a trend, the bigger the volume and the indicators indicate extreme, it's a nice time to take a position. Because there'll be a breakout!\n",
    "\n",
    "If a pullback occurs, which identifies it's a false breakout, it's a great buy or sell opportunity. The protective stop would be the high of the false breakout. I'll just go with the bulls prospective. The bears tried to penetrate a support area. They penetrated it, but they fail and the pullback goes to the support area again. That means the bears are weak, and the bulls just got to know that they are weak. It gives a high probability that the bulls are going to reverse the trend. But even though the bulls don't get to reverse the trend, you'll get a protective stop on the false breakout. If it just continues, you'll be out at the tip of the false breakout. Which is a pretty nice stop-loss."

    "# Trends and Trading Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "A trend appears when a price keeps on rising or falling in a decent amount of time. When an uptrend occurs, it'll make higher highs than the proceeding rally. Opposite when downtrends occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trading ranges are just trying to find the support and resistance. You have to buy at weakness and sell at strength. Whichever that means ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mass Psychology\n",
    "\n",
    "It's either the crowds need to be aimless, greedy or scared. The bulls and bears will fight, and when the bulls are winning an uptrend goes. On the other hand, when the bears are winning, the downtrend goes. The thing is, when a trend actually happens, it actually makes higher highs than the last rally, or lower lows than the last rally. If it doesn't go that much, you're still in the trading zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is the trading zone longer than trends? Let's ask an emotional question. Are you sad all the time? Are you happy all the time? What are your emotions most of the time? Mostly, you don't feel anything. You're emotion, is pretty much aimless. With aimless emotion, it'll make the market just, put in money for this reason and that reason, and sell for this reason and that reason. No analysis and just aimless trading for the amateurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when it comes to trends, they go greedy and scared. But the problem is, that emotion doesn't last that long. Once they get greedy, they get to get scared because of a reverse, a done sign of a trend. And then those emotions return to neutral. Even the time factor of the support and resistance tells us that emotions don't last that long. Mostly, you'll get to neutral. That's where us, professional traders benefit in the trading zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Hard Right Edge\n",
    "\n",
    "The left side of the chart is so easy to see. Trends, trading zones, support, resistance, it's too easy to see and really feels nice that you can see that. But the problem comes on the right side of the chart. You have no idea what it'll look like in the future. It's all about calculating the probability, and managing uncertainty. People don't like uncertainty. Everyone wants to make their probability high, but still, it's not certain. To make the certain about something, they tend to waste time on listening to everyone that might have a similar experience. And they try to find the right exact one, but guess what, every experience is actually unique. And even the circumstances are the same, it's special to the person who lived and experienced that moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty is a must and it's a default in life. You have to get a hang of it. You have to make that comfortable. And for something more important is, you have to get over when you're wrong. Getting something right in the market isn't the main factor. It's about what you're going to do when you're WRONG. Most people don't want to admit their wrong. If they get an analysis wrong, they tend to hold their positions and wait till what they analyzed comes out. If it does, they'll say, \"I'm fucking right! I knew it! I'm fucking smart!\", but when they lose, and get like -30%, they'll just say it was bad luck and blame something else. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing in this paragraph is, dealing with uncertainty. If you thought it was close to certain, a high probability, you have to move with discipline. When you are wrong, admit it, get out. Analyze why you were wrong, and make a new analysis and get in. That's what you have to do, admit your wrong fast and get out of losing!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods and Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it's really important to use indicators that are correlated. The most important thing that you're going to do is, analyzing the information that you have at the moment, and find what the state is. If the indicators all say that it's a trend, you bet on the way it'll rally. \n",
    "\n",
    "I saw a 22-day EMA(Exponential Moving Average), Directional system, and MACD-Histogram. Didn't get to learn what they were, but they'll mostly be taught at like from chapter 22~24. I'll never get to know what they are! God damn it lol. That's why you're reading the TA A-Z book mate!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze the pattern of highs and lows. When rallies keep reaching higher levels and declines keep stopping at higher levels, they identify an uptrend. The pattern of lower lows and lower highs identifies a downtrend, and the pattern of irregular highs and lows points to a trading range.\n",
    "2. Plot a 20-to 30-bar exponential moving average. The direction of its slope identifies the trend. If a moving average has not reached a new high or low in a month, then the market is probably in a trading range.\n",
    "3. When an oscillator, such as MACD-Histogram rises to a new peak, it identifies a powerful trend and suggests that the latest market top is likely to be retested or exceeded.\n",
    "4. Several market indicators, such the Directional system, help identify trends. The Directional system is especially good at catching early stages of new trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade or Wait\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. You identified that there might be a trend coming. A breakout. But the problem is, when to buy it? A lot of professional traders will pretty much wait for this moment. If you hop on a trend, you can sit back and relax a bit. Because you can use wider stops. If it seems to rally more, you can just hold your position. But if it doesn't then you just put a stop! The problem is, traders could just go right away and buy, but as professionals, you must have optimal wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "When are you going to buy when you identify a trend? Before the breakout, during the breakout, or a pullback after the breakout. You can just buy 1/3s at each time and just go for it. It's just a money management strategy because, it's best for you to just get in at a point instead of missing the trend lol. \n",
    "\n",
    "The entry point may not be optimal at trends, but it's pretty much really important in identifying one, and hopping onto one. But at trading zones, it's going to be hard. Because! Trading zones! Duh! Professional traders trade more professionally at that part. So everyone will be analyzing their entry points, and you must get more optimal. In the trading zone, there's not much money you can get! You may have more opportunities, but you have to be really good.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conflicting Timeframes\n",
    "\n",
    "Ooooh Triple Screen trading system! So that's why there's so many monitors out there! I get it! But I wonder if it can be done in one screen. Let's get it!\n",
    "\n",
    "All the timeframes are conflicting. Each stock has actually hundreds of charts. It's based on its timeframe. There could be a trend and a lot of nice signals in one timeframe, but it could be just a flat chart in another. But the longer timeframes are more stronger. A mass psychology of time, makes it more stronger. So when you see something nice in the short-term, try to see the long-term picture too. You have to go short, long, short long.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the big picture, trees, big picture, trees, up and back. In that way, you'll get a huge understanding."

    "Kangaroo tails reflect a fight 'attempt' between the bulls and bears. And the result must be a lost from the crowd that attacked first. If the bulls tried to pull it up, and the bears won the battle, the bulls might as well lose a whole trend. So it could mean a reversal. If the bulls won huge, then it'll actually mean a close with minus! But still, you have to keep considering this tail all the time. Remember though, it's pretty much a short-term indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this tail occurs, it's best to trade against it. When you trade against it, you have to think of when to stop. If you stop on the top, you'll be risking too much. It's best to lower the profit and lower the risk. It's better to just win than lose in a trade. After all, it's a short-term one. So anyways, think where you're going to put your stop positions."
