I'll put all my trading related knowledge over here.
It's hard to format out this repository since it'll be hard what to actually put in or not.
Making all the financial knowledge into mathematical and then interpret into programming, will be the main purpose.
There are things that can't be actually coded though, should that be in this repository?
I'm not sure. I'm thinking of just putting in a Jupyter Notebook for each, but I wonder if that'll be good.
Can all those formulas be categorized? That's a pretty hard thing to do. Since all the information is scattered into other resources.
How about just making it like a library at first? Just trading related, financial engineering stuff goes in here.

## Content
Everything will be written in a Jupyter notebook first, and will be made into a library to use.
