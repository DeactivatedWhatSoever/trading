# Profit
This will trade everything that's digital and will give me profit!!! Of course the algorithms that I put in here should be really well researched and back tested.


This application will have a wrapper that does all the interpreting between the exchange's APIs. Then it'll have the right strategies to execute at that time when the machine is going to actually trade. After the trade, we will need a notification system and need to save the data in a serial way. 
Since this is just a trader, we additionally need a data analysis platform for tradeable asset data. More of a back testing platform. 

## Development Stack
* Language & Framework
    * Python & Flask
    * All the trading data manipulation and stuff are mostly going to be with Python.
    * That's why I chose it and I'm going to get better at it because of AI and stuff.
    * Go will be used for distributed computing and stuff. So laters.
    * I think I should make an admin page but don't really know which one to make it with. 
        * Thinking of Angular or Vue, but there should be a lot of graphs. 
        * Graphs should be an important factor over here, I'm not sure whether I'll do a lot of forms.
* Monitoring & Logging
    * I need to learn a hell of this kind of stuff. 
    * Thinking of reading a few books like `The Art of Monitoring`.
* Infrastructure
    * Database
        * You should study some database stuff and model data properly.
        * Whether to use a NoSQL database. I don't think I'll need any cache memory.
        * I need to process data in a cheap way.
    * Kubernetes
        * Not thinking of just creating a dumb server that just installs everything locally. 
        * The environment needs to be reproduceable and should get up right after the computer reboots.
        * Since it's a trading platform I need to make it really secure and nice.

## Features
This sections is actually just an idea bank. I haven't thought of a lot of things over here, so it's just an exhaustive list.
* Financial data playground
    * This is for actual algorithm research. Finding alpha, writing reports, and doing actual analysis.
    * Stock, cryptocurrency, any sort of trading asset simulation system. This will lead to better research.
* A platform that lets you share all the researches you made. Algorithms, real big things etc. 
    * I think social leading will really be something. I'm thinking of this.
    * I could actually make a huge market over here. But, the things that really make cash, it'll sure have to sold real expensively.
